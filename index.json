Let me know your top recc at @allwynpfr\nAbout this website This is my personal website, made by me. I am quite proud of how quick to load it is\u0026hellip; brings me joy everytime. It\u0026rsquo;s hosted at my github repo and domain registered at Namecheap. I like to mess around with themes. The current one (if I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed it) is PaperMod by Aditya, chill dude, really.\nTo know more on how to use this website check out the manual\nTechnical The code for this website is hosted at my Github repo. I use Hugo as my static site generator. I love how quick and easy to setup it is. I write my posts in Markdown using my knowledge management tool of choice: Obsidian I use this custom bash script to build the site and push the code to github. It\u0026rsquo;s not the most elegant but it does the job. Let me know if you have any improvements. I am still not sure if I should enable comments on here since most of the talking happens on WA/HN/TW or where ever the posts are shared.

Imposter syndrome is quite active in this space.\nMost of the times my writing is quite straightforward and easy to read. However, sometimes it may sound out of place and the writing a bit strange even. At such times, it can be helpful to look at the meta data\u0026ndash; The text at the top or bottom that mentions the tags the piece relates to, the sounds I was listening to, the place from where I wrote the entry and so on. They can provide useful context and [[UZ- Context gives meaning to concepts]]\nIt is necessary then to act and write as you say and say as you feel. This blog is an exploration of just that idea. I want to explore and express all these ideas that I keep coming across continually. I want to share them with others and hope that they gain something just as I\u0026rsquo;ve gained from countless others.\nYou can connect with me on twitter @allwynpfr or subscribe to the RSS feed to get updates everytime I publish a new post.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to countless more days of sharing and learning, Cheers!\n Al  ","permalink":"https://allwynfernandes.github.io/write-simply/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s kind of difficult to write what you think.

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find much. Just a few YouTubers sharing their hacky idea around the topic. I must say though that they did help me quite a bit. I ended up creating my own script. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share it since it might help others stuck in this space. I have tried my best to comment the code so that you know what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nRunning the script First let\u0026rsquo;s look at how to run the script as is. You can download and run it right away! Just be sure to change the folder path and blog theme.\n./deploysite.sh \u0026#34;new post about bash scripts on 2021-05-02\u0026#34; I hate making people wait for me, the same goes with the programs I use. I\u0026rsquo;d rather mention my arguments straight up instead of the program issuing a prompt and wait while my clumsy self fills it. So that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the double quotes. The ./deploysite.sh runs the script, the \u0026quot;new post...\u0026quot; is my commit message for github.\nI love this script because it\u0026rsquo;s like hitting the publish button on Medium or other blogging platforms. Super easy!\nThe script I hope I have commented the code well enough. Feel free to edit the text insde the quotes on the echo lines to whatever you\u0026rsquo;d want the script to tell you. I\u0026rsquo;m not really a fan of entering my github credentials everytime I make a commit which is why I use the git config command you can read more about it here. In a nutshell, it stores your login details locally so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to login everytime you push a commit.\nAlso, the $1 is just bash for the first argument after the script name. In this case, it is our commit message.\n#!/bin/bash # bash script to deploy hugo website to github # at first run do chmod +x {{name of file}} to get permissions # Testing bash input echo \u0026#34;Your string was: $1\u0026#34; # [0] Collecting variables echo \u0026#34;Bash script to deploy hugo website to github\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Set Github username \u0026amp; password\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; git config --global credential.helper \u0026#39;cache --timeout 7200\u0026#39; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Generating site static files\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [1] Generate Hugo static site cd ~/Github/af/blog/allwynfernandes/ hugo -t PaperMod echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Code Pushed to blog folder\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [2] Push to blog folder cd ~/Github/af/blog/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; git push origin main echo \u0026#34;ALERT: HTML pushed to static folder\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [3] Push to satic site folder cd ~/Github/af/blog/allwynfernandes/public/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; git push origin main echo \u0026#34; \u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;==================\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Site deployed successfully\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;==================\u0026#34; Now of course if you do not want to mention a commit message, you could simply replace the \u0026quot;$1\u0026quot; with something like \u0026quot;Updated site\u0026quot;. The code would work a-okay and now you\u0026rsquo;re just a key press away from deploying your site. However, do bear in mind that this is considered bad practice and its necessary to add a meaningful commit message every time you push code to your repo.\nThe script takes about 1.7 seconds to run and mostly solve my problems and saves me extra keystrokes. I also added a feature where I don\u0026rsquo;t have to navigate to the specific folder to run the script. I simply open the terminal and type deploysite \u0026quot;Some commit message\u0026quot; and everything is taken care of. I shall cover this in another post on how to run your scripts from anywhere and without the .sh extensions and so on. I hope the post was help you and that now you\u0026rsquo;re well on your way to create your own bash scripts!\n","permalink":"https://allwynfernandes.github.io/deploy-hugo-site-bash-script/","summary":"I have been looking on the internet for quite a while for a half decent bash script to deploy my hugo site and commit the blog related files to github.
