[{"content":"I have been looking on the internet for quite a while for a half decent bash script to deploy my hugo site and commit the blog related files to github. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find much. Just a few YouTubers sharing their hacky idea around the topic. I must say though that they did help me quite a bit. I ended up creating my own script. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share it since it might help others stuck in this space. I have tried my best to comment the code so that you know what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nRunning the script First let\u0026rsquo;s look at how to run the script as is. You can download and run it right away! Just be sure to change the folder path and blog theme.\n./deploysite.sh \u0026#34;new post about bash scripts on 2021-05-02\u0026#34; I hate making people wait for me, the same goes with the programs I use. I\u0026rsquo;d rather mention my arguments straight up instead of the program issuing a prompt and wait while my clumsy self fills it. So that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the double quotes. The ./deploysite.sh runs the script, the \u0026quot;new post...\u0026quot; is my commit message for github.\nI love this script because it\u0026rsquo;s like hitting the publish button on Medium or other blogging platforms. Super easy!\nThe script I hope I have commented the code well enough. Feel free to edit the text insde the quotes on the echo lines to whatever you\u0026rsquo;d want the script to tell you. I\u0026rsquo;m not really a fan of entering my github credentials everytime I make a commit which is why I use the git config command you can read more about it here. In a nutshell, it stores your login details locally so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to login everytime you push a commit.\nAlso, the $1 is just bash for the first argument after the script name. In this case, it is our commit message.\n#!/bin/bash # bash script to deploy hugo website to github # at first run do chmod +x {{name of file}} to get permissions # Testing bash input echo \u0026#34;Your string was: $1\u0026#34; # [0] Collecting variables echo \u0026#34;Bash script to deploy hugo website to github\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Set Github username \u0026amp; password\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; git config --global credential.helper \u0026#39;cache --timeout 7200\u0026#39; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Generating site static files\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [1] Generate Hugo static site cd ~/Github/af/blog/allwynfernandes/ hugo -t PaperMod echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Code Pushed to blog folder\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [2] Push to blog folder cd ~/Github/af/blog/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; git push origin main echo \u0026#34;ALERT: HTML pushed to static folder\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;------------\u0026#34; # [3] Push to satic site folder cd ~/Github/af/blog/allwynfernandes/public/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; git push origin main echo \u0026#34; \u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;==================\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;ALERT: Site deployed successfully\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;==================\u0026#34; The script takes about 1.7 seconds to run and mostly solve my problems and saves me extra keystrokes. I also added a feature where I don\u0026rsquo;t have to navigate to the specific folder to run the script. I simply open the terminal and type deploysite \u0026quot;Some commit message\u0026quot; and everything is taken care of. I shall cover this in another post on how to run your scripts from anywhere and without the .sh extensions and so on. I hope the post was help you and that now you\u0026rsquo;re well on your way to create your own bash scripts!\n","permalink":"https://allwynfernandes.github.io/deploy-hugo-site-bash-script/","summary":"I have been looking on the internet for quite a while for a half decent bash script to deploy my hugo site and commit the blog related files to github.
