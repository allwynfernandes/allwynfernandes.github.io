      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of difficult to write what you think. The brain is a mess of ideas, plans and desires. Broken thoughts are abound. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to instead write as you speak. Assuming speaking comes naturally to you.
I dont speak a lot with people. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a limited set of friends with whom I interact in limited ways. However, I seem to speak a lot with myself. Most of the thoughts and ramblings posted on this blog and the countless others in the journal come from that tête-à-tête</description>

      <description>I have been looking on the internet for quite a while for a half decent bash script to deploy my hugo site and commit the blog related files to github. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find much. Just a few YouTubers sharing their hacky idea around the topic. I must say though that they did help me quite a bit. I ended up creating my own script. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it since it might help others stuck in this space.</description>
